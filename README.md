# Sequential-Data-Processing
First homework for the data structures course.
An implementation of some machine learning methods used for correction of errors, data uniformization and data completion. The only data structure that I used was a doubly linked list.
The code can be run by executing:
./tema1 "command", where "command" can be each of the following:
-> "--e1";
-> "--e2";
-> "--e3";
-> "--u";
-> "--c";
-> "--st"<delta>.
